# djangoproject
Working on my first django project.

I also took a look at this site for inspiration for projects: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/

I am using this website as a tutorial: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html 

I want to eventually add in this pygame snake game so I can play it online instead of from a gui locally: https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/
